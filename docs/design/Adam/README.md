# Design Philosophy:

For my design I chose two main views for the application, a primary view to optimize information consumtion, and a view to maximize user customization and interaction. The side menus and space for options giving the team a lot of room to change what functionality we show directly to the user and which functionality we hide in menus for more advanced users. These two views can be used for any content we would like to show in different variations. When we recieve further requirements we can create more specific views for each user scene.
