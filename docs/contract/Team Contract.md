# Team Vision and Goal

    We strive to function as a team that will produce industry-standard work by the end of this course. We aspire to complete an exemplary project for our resumes that will be an accurate representation of our fullest capabilities in both collaborative skills and work ethic. We hope to create a project that can showcase each individual's skills and specialties without undermining one another. We intend to have this project serve as a continuation of our learning that will aid us in cementing our knowledge base and skills to further assist us in our future careers, be it software-related or otherwise.

# Meetings

	Regular required team meetings are to be held at least once a week during our designated course period, any other full team meetings must be decided on by the entire group on a week-by-week basis. The group will collaboratively decide on a time and place to make sure every member can attend this meeting.

	Every team member must know the work completed in the previous sprint and how it impacts the overall project at least at a basic level to be able to contribute effectively in the weekly planned meetings.

	Punctuality to all team meetings, both required and additional meetings, is mandatory. It is expected that all group members, or group members who have agreed to be present, are on time unless otherwise specified and is communicated to the other group members.

    Any and all notes taken during a meeting will be shared in an accessible location to all group members to allow for note-taking to be fluid and flexible. All notes taken must be shared by the end of the day at the latest and preferably by the end of the meeting.

# Pull Requests

	Pull requests (PRs) must receive two code reviews that result in approvals and any changes requested to be resolved. If the PR does not meet those baseline standards, it will not be merged until it does.

    PRs are expected to be posted in a timely manner to allow for other group members to review and potentially request changes to be made. As such it is preferred that PRs are posted on the Saturday of the sprint at the latest to allow for at least one day of review and changes to be made. The absolute deadline for publishing a PR is 10:30 PM Sunday night of a given sprint to allow for the Team Logs to be produced accurately for the sprint before midnight.
    
    The PRs must follow best practices as well as the standards outlined within project documents. All tests must pass, conflicts must all be resolved, issues and PRs must be linked and properly closed.

# Expectations on Communication and Collaboration Process

## Frequency of Communication

	Communication is mandatory at meetings, both required and planned, as well as through online means such as the project-specific Discord, which will be used for day-to-day communication.

## Communication Behavior

	Should an issue arise it must be communicated to the rest of the group or to the parties involved. In meeting situations, cordial communication must be maintained, and respect for each speaker is required. There is no set amount of speaking that is required or considered excessive, so long as there are no issues caused. Respectful communication must be upheld at all times, both in person and online settings.

## Channels for Discussion

	For general discussions in online settings, the established Discord project server will be used, which has multiple specific channels for different topics, such as general discussion or project submission channels.

## Collaboration Process

	It is expected that every member of the group takes an issue from the Kanban board at the beginning of the sprint to outline the expected work each member must complete. This is also a necessity to prevent overlapping tasks or unnecessary work that does not produce meaningful results for the current milestone.
	Each member must try to complete at least two code reviews each sprint. These reviews should be meaningful, actionable, and comprehensive to be useful for the author to improve further or outline positives for other group members.

# Expectations on Distribution and Delivery of Work

    All project tasks must first be defined on the project Kanban board, and with a related issue linked in the repo. At the beginning of each sprint, it is expected that each member self-assigns a task in a first-come-first-serve fashion to avoid overlap and to ensure work for the sprint for each group member. Any group member can speak up or share issues they may have with unfair task sizes being distributed among the group.

    All team members are responsible for being familiar with the overall state of the project as well as the work required to meet and surpass expectations for the given milestone. Team members are also individually responsible for contributing a fair and relatively equal portion of work. As well, it is expected that team members create tasks wherever they notice gaps in the current tasks needed to fulfil the milestone. Any and all duplicates of tasks will be resolved through outside communications.

    The expected quality of work should be industry-standard-level code, readable, clean, and easily understandable with proper commenting following our standards laid out in our documentation. The focus is on quality results and readable code rather than on the number of lines of code written.

# Commitment to Avoid Inappropriate Behaviour

	Each group member is responsible for their own individual conduct and actions taken within the team. As such it is expected that each member acts in a way befitting professional standards that remains empathetic to each other's team members.

# Resolution Strategy

	Should an issue arise, team members are responsible for communicating their grievances in a respectful and productive manner. This includes, but is not limited to, providing actionable and useful feedback to achieve a productive result. Should no consensus be made, each member involved must acknowledge differences in opinion and attempt to move past them for the sake of collaboration and the group. As a follow-up, in all disagreements, the end goal must be to work past it and put collaboration first for the sake of the quality of the project and the team morale as a whole.

## Disciplinary procedures for the first offence

    Should an offence occur, it will be noted by all members involved in their personal logs as well as in the weekly reflection survey to report it officially. Each member of the team will also make an acknowledgement of the issue within their own personal logs to ensure that each member is aware of and keeping up with issues formed within the group.

    Further actions would be to either attempt to resolve the issue through discourse or remedy the work that may have caused the dispute to relieve tensions and reach an agreement within the next sprint's timeframe.

## Disciplinary procedures for repeated offences

	Should a group member continuously cause issues and refuse to compromise, change, or communicate, depending on the severity of the issue, a confrontation with the entire group present will be held. In such a situation, all previous and current issues will be brought up, compared, and persecuted based on the gravity of the conflicts. We will address each infraction against the baseline team agreements and contract and discuss ways to improve or resolve these issues within the next sprint.

	If there were to be a third recurrence this will be brought directly to the Professor and will likely lead to one of the following. Either an agreement by the accused to resolve the issue, promise to improve and communicate, and have no remaining chances before executing the firing clause. Or if there is no recourse possible, the use of the firing clause will be brought up and heavily considered, putting forward the motion to remove the offending member from the group.
