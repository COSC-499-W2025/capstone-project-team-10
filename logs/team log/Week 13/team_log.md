## Reflection
This week was very eventful, since it's the week before the presentation and milestone, we saw a LOT of work being done and a lot of last minute rush but overall we pulled through and the project is looking really great right now. We have a working Portfolio, Resume, and Skills generator which displays information as HTML and PDF.
