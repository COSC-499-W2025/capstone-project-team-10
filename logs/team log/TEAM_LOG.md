## Test Report
- No Testing Required Yet

## Reflection / Additional Context
- For week six we deliborated over the choice of coding languages due to the updated system requirement and switched languages to Python. We then updated the coding environment to reflect this as well as completing other requirements for week six with the readme file. Next we plan to break down test cases and configurations to give us a solid starting point for launching the project.
