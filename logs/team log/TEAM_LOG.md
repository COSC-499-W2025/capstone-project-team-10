- For week six we deliborated over the choice of coding languages due to the updated system requirement and switched languages to Python. We then updated the coding environment to reflect this as well as completing other requirements for week six with the readme file. Next we plan to break down test cases and configurations to give us a solid starting point for launching the project.

## Reflection / Additional Context

- Week 8 was a very strong week in terms of delivery and individual work from all group members. Each member took on an issue from the GitHub and completed their task before the end of the week. As a team, we were able to knock six items off our issues board and already have tasks lined up for the next week. One thing we will need to review is how we can integrate our respective work with one another. We have added a lot of code from different coders, so it will be necessary to review it together to make sure the code is compatible with each other's code. Overall, it was a solid week and a great start to the coding aspect of this project.
