## Additional Notes
- Hectic week and days - tests suite from last week were bugfixed (within PR for #60), but there is much more to be done, especially, after connecting the modules into the main loop of the program, namely FAS and FSS.
- Tests are to be reviewed, fact-check and added to examine the connectability of all of the modules
- Ticking of more of the PR, but, with extra consideration for compatibility of tests and connectability.
