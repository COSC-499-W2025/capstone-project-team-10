## Additional Notes

- Having finished all of the log converter module, we now shift towards the usability of the entire repo - mainly tuning up all of the parameters for the CLI, cleaning up redundancies, and trying to ship our product to be usable and demo-able
- Tasks will be assigned to work towards this goal, and more issues will be published to clear out the rest of the Milestones
- Overall, the team is working with utmost speed while ensuring efficiency, to be ready for the upcoming demo and Milestone 1
