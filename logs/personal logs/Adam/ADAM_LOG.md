## Recap

I Spent most of my week outlining the path for our group forward, creating tickets, managing requirements, and developing draft test cases for developers to fill in as the features get fully developed, this allows us to have good expectations for what our inputs and outputs for our features should be, and the tests just require adaptation to the developers specific implementation. I also completed our teams WBS. 

In the next sprint I will primarily be tackling project planning and documentation, as well as adding the flags and process to our CLI to allow for zip file processing.
