## Tasks
This week we decided on the coding tasks for each person and reviewed documentation and test cases for the weeks to come.

# Week 8 (10/19/2025 - 10/26/2025)

## Recap
This week we started the bulk of coding, I implemented the zip extract module along with tests. The module extracts zip folders into a designated folder within our app, and always keeps a maximum of 5.

# Week 9 (10/26/2025 - 11/2/2025)

## Recap
I finished the image analysis module this week, our work is getting a little more complicated and I think I'm going to have to spend some extra time looking through my peers' code and reviewing them over again as the program gets bigger so that I refresh my understanding of how everything is working.

# Week 10 (11/9/2025 - 11/16/2025)

I got confused and thought the peer evaluation for November 9th were on November 16th because of reading week, but this is what I worked on:
- Researching / learning new things
- Coding
- Reviewing teammates' code
- Testing my code
- Team meetings
- Figuring out problems on my own

  ## Recap
  I worked on the functionality for delta scans of previous results and implemented a simple cache system. I was told that it would be better to connect my implementation with Log.py instead of a cache, so I will have to make major tweaks to my pull request. I had some difficulty implementing it but I have a better idea of how it works right now so hopefully changing it won't be too difficult. So for this upcoming week I will work on that and also work on refining skill extraction for modules I've previously worked on (wherever it applies). The project is going well.
