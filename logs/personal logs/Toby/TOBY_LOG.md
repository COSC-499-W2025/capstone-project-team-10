## Recap

- For term 2 week 1, I worked on the refactor of FAS extra data and mock design for the GUI (Milestone 2)
  - Since FAS extra data is getting bigger with more file types, it should be a seperate feature, which I made this week
  + Things that went well: The GUI is design with figma so it looks way better than expected
  - Things that did not went well: The refactor means that I have to redesign the test cases which is a lot (I still got it done)
- I will start work on milestone 2 starting next week with the given guidelines

## Recap

- For week 13, I worked on the showcase module (generating resume and porfolio)
    - I made it so that the showcase.py now use the key skills of FAS to generate and display a human readable resume/portfolio
    - I have to change up FAS a bit since FAS has a lot of details so I have to take all that details and make it into key skills to output to showcase
- For week 14, it is our last week, I think we will go over everything to see if we miss anything
