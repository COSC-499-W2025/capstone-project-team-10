# Recap

This week I spent time setting up the initial file search service, that will take in a file or folder path as well as a set of excluded paths and compare against them to count or access only specific files.

Next week I plan to expand upon this and add more functionality to it, possibly by implementing aspects of the analysis service into the file search service or continuing to set up different types of specific file analysis services for currently uncovered file types.

This week I began work on coding the basic tests to lay out the path for test driven development, I did this collaboratively with Adam. This task puts down the foundation to work from going forwards with other features and aspects of the project. As well, I have continued to look into and somewhat apply the basics of metadata extraction from files and .git folders that will need to be applied in the future within specific tests.
